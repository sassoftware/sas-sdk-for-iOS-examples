# Getting Started: Personalize the [SAS Mobile BI App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sas-mobile-bi/id511030524?mt=8)

The first step many users want to take is to personalize the existing SAS Mobile BI app by building a mobile app that uses their app name and icon. If you create a personalized app based on the [SASKitCustomApp example](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-sdk-for-iOS-examples/tree/master/SASKitCustomApp), you can create an Xcode project with the app name you desire. "SASKitCustomApp" is the default app name for this sample.


## Simply add your icon to the Xcode project:
